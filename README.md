# quiz-challenge

Undertaking this challenge has enabled me to reinfoce the lessons during the past week focused on utllsing vailla javascript and manipulating the dom. Also I have been able to to revisit some of the html and css skills I developed prior in the course to create this challenge. I haven't been able to fulfill all of the objectives of this challenge, I still need to incorprate a timer function and also build the highscore functionality further by enabling the clear highscore button to delete the scores from local storage. I have been able to grow significantly during the undertaking of this challenge and look forward to improving my quiz further.
